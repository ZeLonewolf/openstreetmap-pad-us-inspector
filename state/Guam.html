		<p>
			This page was generated on <i>Dec 02, 2020</i>
		<p>
			This analysis was generated by the <a
				href="https://github.com/ZeLonewolf/openstreetmap-pad-us-inspector">OPUSInspect
				script</a>, created by <a
				href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:ZeLonewolf">Brian
				Sperlongano</a>. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the <a
				href="https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-area-categories">IUCN
				Protection Category</a> that should be tagged using the <strong><a
				href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:protect_class">protect_class</a>=*</strong>
			key for protected areas in each state in the United States. In
			addition, this script locates protected areas that are already tagged
			in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> and
			matches them by name with PAD-US in order to identify areas which may
			be incorrectly tagged with <strong><a
				href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:protect_class">protect_class</a>=*</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Protected areas that are not assigned an IUCN Category should still
			be tagged <strong><a
				href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leisure">leisure</a>=<a
				href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure%3Dnature_reserve">nature_reserve</a></strong>
			(which renders in Carto), but omit <strong><a
				href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:protect_class">protect_class</a>=*</strong>.
			Be aware that minor differences in naming or spelling may cause false
			positives or negatives; mappers should examine this table carefully.
		</p>
		<p>Additionally, mappers should consult the PAD-US map-based
			viewer when making a determination:
		<ul>
			<li><b><a href="https://maps.usgs.gov/padus/">Protected
						Area Database of the United States - Map Viewer</a></b></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>The PAD-US Data Source</h2>
		<p>As a work of the United States Federal Government, the PAD-US
			database is in the Public Domain and is suitable as a data source for
			OpenStreetMap. PAD-US is an aggregation over over 100 other data
			sources. Mappers should inspect PAD-US for accuracy and assume that
			there may be errors.</p>
		<p>Note that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Areas listed as &quot;Not Reported&quot; meet the definition
				of IUCN protection, but have not yet been assigned a category, and
				thus tagging with a category is not appropriate.</li>
			<li>Areas should not be tagged with <strong><a
					href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:protect_class">protect_class</a>=*</strong>
				if their IUCN category cannot be determined. Instead, these areas
				should simply be tagged with <strong><a
					href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leisure">leisure</a>=<a
					href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure%3Dnature_reserve">nature_reserve</a></strong>,
				which will render in OSM Carto.
			</li>
			<li>In some cases, more than one IUCN category is tagged. In
				these cases, PAD-US indicates that internal portions of the named
				protected area are assigned different IUCN categories.</li>
		</ul>

						assigned to protected areas for inclusion in the United Nations
						Environment World Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC) World
						Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) and the Commission for
						Environmental Cooperation (CEC) North American Terrestrial
						Protected Areas Database. IUCN defines a protected area as, "A
						clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and
						managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the
						long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem
						services and cultural values" (includes GAP Status Code 1 and 2
						only). Categorization follows as:
						<ul>
							<li><b>IUCN Category Ia</b> - Strict Nature Reserves are
								strictly protected areas set aside to protect biodiversity and
								possibly geological or geomorphological features, where human
								visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited
								to ensure preservation of the conservation values. Such
								protected areas can serve as indispensable reference areas for
								scientific research and monitoring;</li>
							<li><b>IUCN Category Ib</b> - Wilderness Areas protected
								areas are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas,
								retaining their natural character and influence, without
								permanent or significant human habitation, which are protected
								and managed to preserve their natural condition;</li>
							<li><b>IUCN Category II</b> - National Park protected areas
								are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect
								large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of
								species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also
								provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally
								compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and
								visitor opportunities;</li>
							<li><b>IUCN Category III</b> - Natural Monument or Feature
								protected areas are set aside to protect a specific natural
								monument, which can be a landform, seamount, submarine caverns,
								geological features such as caves, or even a living feature such
								as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected
								areas and often have high visitor value;</li>
							<li><b>IUCN Category IV</b> - Habitat and (or) species
								management protected areas aim to protect particular species or
								habitats and management reflects this priority. Many category IV
								protected areas will need regular, active interventions to
								address the requirements of particular species or to maintain
								habitats, but this is not a requirement of this category;</li>
							<li><b>IUCN Category V</b> Protected landscape and (or)
								seascape protected areas occur where the interaction of people
								and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character
								with significant ecological, biological, cultural, and scenic
								value;</li>
							<li><b>IUCN Category VI</b> - Protected area with
								sustainable use (community based, non-industrial) of natural
								resources are generally large, with much of the area in a
								more-or-less natural condition and whereas a proportion is under
								sustainable natural resource management and where such
								exploitation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.</li>
							<li>Other Conservation Areas are not recognized by IUCN at
								this time; however, they will be evaluated to determine if they
								meet the definition of Other Effective Area Based Conservation
								Measures (OECMs) for inclusion in the WDPA following recently
								released guidance. These areas (GAP Status Code 3 areas only)
								are attributed in the 'IUCN Category' Domain along with
								'Unassigned' areas (GAP Status Code 4).</li>
							<li>In addition, a few areas are included as 'Not Reported',
								these areas meet the definition of IUCN protection (i.e. GAP
								Status Code 1 or 2) but 'IUCN Category' has not yet been
								assigned and categorical assignment is not appropriate. See the
								PAD-US Data Manual for a summary of methods.</li>
