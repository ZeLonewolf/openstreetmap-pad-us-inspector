# openstreetmap-pad-us-inspector

This project attempts to automate the identification of [IUCN Protected Area Categories](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-area-categories) for [protected areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area) 

This utility downloads and parses the USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US), and generates a collection of pages that show the tagging status of IUCN Categories for these areas.  Mappers can use this data as a resource when determining *whether* an area should be tagged with **[protect_class](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:protect_class)=***.
