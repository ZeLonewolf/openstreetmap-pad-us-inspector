This table is generated by the [https://github.com/ZeLonewolf/openstreetmap-pad-us-inspector OPUSInspect script], by [[User:ZeLonewolf|ZeLonewolf]] on $DATE.  (This script output is a work in progress and cannot be relied on for mapping).

Note that:
* Areas listed as "Not Reported" meet the definition of IUCN protection, but have not yet been assigned a category, and categorization is not appropriate.
* Areas should not be tagged with {{tag|protect_class}} if their IUCN category cannot be determined.  Instead, these areas should simply be tagged with {{tag|leisure|nature_reserve}}, which will render in OSM Carto.
